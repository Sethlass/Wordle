Completed Project For Cyber Network System and Design.

Project Description:
In this project, you will design a network application of your choice. Here are the constraints:

You must have a single client and a single server.
The client should begin by asking the user to enter the IP address of the server.
A complete interaction between the two must involve multiple messages passed between the client and server.
The client must involve some sort of user interaction. The server could as well, but it is not required.
The server should have some information that the client is trying to access in some way (like the Hangman word list in project 2).
The client should be written in Python and the server should be written in Java, or vice versa.
You may use either UDP or TCP as the transport protocol.
 

As part of the assignment, you must design the appropriate application layer protocol between the client and server.
