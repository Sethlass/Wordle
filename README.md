Completed Project For Cyber Network System and Design.

Project Description:
In this project, you will design a network application of your choice. Here are the constraints:

You must have a single client and a single server.
The client should begin by asking the user to enter the IP address of the server.
A complete interaction between the two must involve multiple messages passed between the client and server.
The client must involve some sort of user interaction. The server could as well, but it is not required.
The server should have some information that the client is trying to access in some way (like the Hangman word list in project 2).
The client should be written in Python and the server should be written in Java, or vice versa.
You may use either UDP or TCP as the transport protocol.
 

As part of the assignment, you must design the appropriate application layer protocol between the client and server.

 

If you are not feeling particularly creative, you can code a client and server to play the classic game Guess The Number. The server thinks of an integer between 1 and 1000. The client guesses the number, and the server tells the client if the guess is correct, high, or low. The client continues to guess until they get it right. The server then asks the client if they want to play again. (Remember this project must be your own original work. Do not use computers to help generate code for this project.)

 

Please submit to the Project 3 Proposal assignment a short description of your project idea by Monday, November 27 at 9 pm. If you want to do guess the number, just say you’re doing guess the number; you don’t have to describe it. At that time, you should also tell me if you wish to work with a partner. Remember you cannot work with the same person as on either project 1 or 2.

 

If you submit a project of your own choice and it works correctly, you will earn a 10-point bonus.

 

On December 4, you will submit a description of the protocol your project uses, giving the exact format and purpose of each possible message. Please provide a sample timing diagram. This must also include instructions for me on how to run and interact with the sides of your application. You will also submit the (well-commented!) code for both the client and server. All files should be submitted in a single zip file.

 

In class on December 4, you will have the opportunity to demo your project to the class. Demoing will give you a 1-point bonus; demoing a working program earns a 5-point bonus.
